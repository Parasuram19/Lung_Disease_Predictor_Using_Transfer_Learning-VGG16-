# Lung Disease Predictor using Transfer Learning (VGG16)

This project implements a lung disease prediction model using transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture.  It's designed to classify lung conditions based on medical images (e.g., X-rays or CT scans).

## Overview

This project leverages the power of transfer learning by utilizing a pre-trained VGG16 model.  The VGG16 model, pre-trained on a large dataset like ImageNet, has learned to extract useful features from images.  We fine-tune this model on a dataset of lung disease images to adapt it for our specific classification task.  This approach often yields better results with less data compared to training a model from scratch.

## Features

* **Transfer Learning:** Utilizes the pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction.
* **Fine-tuning:**  Fine-tunes the VGG16 model on the lung disease dataset.
* **Image Preprocessing:**  Includes image preprocessing steps (resizing, normalization, etc.) to prepare the images for the model.
* **Model Training and Evaluation:**  Provides scripts for training the model and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* **Prediction:**  Allows for making predictions on new lung disease images.  *(If implemented)*
* **Data Augmentation:**  *(If used)*  May include data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness and generalization.
